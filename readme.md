### It's not real fieldwork until you need to camp out of the lab truck and use playground drinking fountain water to process eelgrass samples :wink:

*Martin and Minako in "the lab"*

### Throwback to that one time we almost missed the 7am low tide in Tofino because some hooligans in Ucluelet vandalized the truck windows with surf wax and let air out of one of the tires. Thank goodness we've changed the truck tires enough to make a swift recovery :muscle:

*Made it to Tofino and sampled EVERYTHING just before the tide washed us out*

### Minako's house for the week.
