# SEAGRASS, DIATOMS, AND OTHER MICROBES
### A collaborative project between the Parfrey Lab at UBC and IMERSS on Galiano Island


#### Project Description
Eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows are home to a diverse number of species, including fish, crabs, algae, and microorganisms. Eelgrass ecosystems contribute to many important coastal processes that humans rely on, such as carbon storage and coastal protection. Although eelgrass is well studied worldwide, there is little research that investigates the epiphytic microbes on leaf surfaces. Using scanning electron microscopy, we are mapping the surface of eelgrass leaves to visualize the spatial patterns and potential interactions of bacteria, fungi, and diatoms along the surface of the leaf. Additionally, we are cataloging bacterial, fungal, and diatom community diversity on eelgrass leaves and how diversity changes over time.
